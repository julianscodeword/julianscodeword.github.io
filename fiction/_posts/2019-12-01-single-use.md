We found her in a vending machine at the end of platform twelve. Jane saw it first--the little hand that emerged from the place you usually find your chocolate bar.

"I've got enough on my plate already," I said.

Jane's face was pale and slick with evening dew. "Stop being such an idiot and help me get it out."

But it wouldn't budge, no matter how desperately we rattled that cage. The machine was, after all, designed to do only two things: to accept money--often more than it needed--and to deliver through its swinging doors something that you didn't need but suddenly found that you couldn't go without.

After a while, Jane stopped trying and turned to me. "Have you got any change?"

I pulled a dollar out of my wallet and held it up between my thumb and forefinger. "Just so you know, I was saving this for a drink."

Jane rolled her eyes as she put my coin into the machine and hammered the buttons like someone calling an elevator. A gear turned over a second later and the machine seemed to relinquish its mechanical grip. Together, we tugged and wrestled until we felt a pop that forced us back onto the platform. I lay there for a minute, smeared with melted chocolate and covered in a smattering of biscuit crumbs as I held the new baby in my arms. The words congratulations, it's a girl were whispered on the wind.

I shrugged my jacket off and wrapped it around her, shielding her against the cool evening like she was a delicate flame. Her cries were louder now that she was free of the machine, so I rocked back and forth under the floodlight coming from the nearby football ground until she stopped crying.

"That's better now, isn't it?" I said.

Our train arrived reliably late, ferrying the usual ghouls to and from their evening rituals. Their eyes were harsh and unknowing, so I cradled my bundle deeper into the folds of my green jacket as we stepped onto the carriage.

Half an hour later, we spilled out onto the moonlit streets of Surrey Hills and ambled along to my shoebox. Jane stayed with the baby while I headed out to the back. In the darkened garage, the outlines of unwanted things hovered awkwardly. There was a malevolence about them, as if they were hiding a secret over in the corner behind last year's party favours. Shivering, I rummaged around until I found the small bassinet that was there when I started renting the house.

"Let's call her Cola," I said, returning to the house with the bassinet under my arm.

"Like the drink?"

"Yeah. It's kinda funny, right?"

Jane furrowed her eyebrows. "Don't they say not to start with a name? You'll get attached or something."

"I think you're talking about strays." I said, heading towards my bedroom. I placed Cola down at the end of my bed and ran my hand through her hair. That's weird. There was something perfectly unnatural about it. It crackled under my touch like a plastic bag flapping about in the wind.

I called out "Jane" to ask for a second opinion but she was already there, waiting in the doorway.

"I really have to give Ron his money," she said, twisting her long, wavy hair up into a bun.

"Huh?"

"Will you be okay looking after her? I'd stay but you know Ron."

"But--" There was no good reason to refuse and I knew it; I had no one else to care for and nowhere else to be. "--don't you think we should turn her in to the police?"

"The police? Do you know what happens to kids like this?"

I shrugged.

"They go into the system. And the system is crappy. Really crappy." Jane narrowed her blue eyes. I knew she was projecting memories of her own upbringing onto Cola but I couldn't point any of that out.

"Someone could be looking for her," I offered.

"A newborn doesn't just turn up in a vending machine, Charlie. She needs us."

I groaned. "Just tonight, okay?"

"Just tonight."

The next morning Jane called to see how we were going.

"Better," I said, encouraged by the warm morning. Cola was over by the television, babbling away to herself while she played with my keys. "When are you coming over?"

"I've got an exam this afternoon. I'll drop by after that."

"This afternoon? Honestly Jane, I have things to do."

"Take her to the zoo. She’ll love it."

"Fine."

We arrived at the zoo an hour later, Cola swinging from my shoulders by a sheet I'd exhumed from the back of a closet. After spending most of the morning watching the echidnas, the platypuses and the emus, we made the treacherous journey to Africa. There we found the newspaper-print zebras and the giraffes with their necks half in morning cumulus; the elephants frothing about in their chocolate milkshake; and the big cats, as retiring as they were in my own childhood.

For lunch, I bought an overpriced sandwich and a bottle of water from the zoo cafeteria and Cola sipped on a small carton of juice. We bumped into an old friend while plotting out the rest of our afternoon.

"Charlie boy? Is that you?"

"Eric!"

"What's this? I didn't know you were a dad," he said, ruffling Cola's hair. "This one over here’s Alex." He patted the boy next to him forward roughly.

"How's it going?" I said, stooping to give the kid a high five.

Eric and I were more than happy to reminisce about high school, but the kids were restless. After agreeing to continue our chat at Eric’s place the next day, we said our goodbyes and parted ways.

On our way to the lemurs, I dumped the remains of our lunch into a bin that looked like its meal had been even less satisfying than ours. My screwed-up bottle escaped the bin and rolled away, but I bent down and stuffed it back into the little window on the side. Cola watched me curiously the whole time.

We giggled like maniacs at the lemurs and their acrobatics but it was the butterflies that Cola loved the most. At first, Cola rumbled unhappily in her carrier as I pushed through into the tropical heat of the butterfly enclosure. But as I turned to make a quick retreat towards the exit, a green and silver butterfly landed on my arm. Cola smiled as she watched it flex its origami wings.

As we stood there, an old lady came to ask if she could take a photo of the two of us. "Sure", I said. Cola and I smiled and dentures reflected our smiles right back at us with one of her own. My whole body fizzed over with effervescence; nothing else mattered--it was just the two of us and this symbol of new beginnings. I leaned forward and whispered "you and I, baby, we're going to do amazing things."

As I looked down, though, I noticed that her little eyes, so full of excitement a moment ago, had gone cloudy, like a plastic bottle left to harden in the sun. Waving my hand in front of her face did nothing to get a reaction, so I headed towards the exit on legs that couldn't carry me fast enough and cradled my daughter closer to my chest. Outside, the cool air dried the sweat off my face and back.

I had Jane on the phone in seconds. "It's probably just the heat. Get some rest," she said.

As if rest could fix anything. That night was hell--Cola woke up every half an hour needing something; was it food or comfort or something even more basic than that?

Jane and I took it in turns to look after her--offering whatever lullabies and stories we could conjure up from our own distant childhoods. Our vigils hung lazily with the promise of sleep; the same sleep was spoiled by the knowledge that our dreaded wake up call would come again far too soon. And all the while, it seemed to me that something was amiss, something more than the usual cries of a baby; a message that Cola was trying to pass on.

Somehow, we survived long enough to watch the sun rise on another day. As the long shadows of early morning crept across my room, they cast Cola's bassinet in deep shadow. She was finally sound asleep, so I left her there with Jane while I washed the night's demons away.

After my shower, we picked up some lunch and made our way to Eric's place--a cozy little single-fronted house in the middle of Northcote.

Eric greeted us at the door with a smile and waved us in. The whole house was empty, except for some boxes scattered about the rooms. It made you think of a museum with an installation of modern art, the shapes of things left for you to guess at.

"We're moving out of this place next week," said Eric’s wife, Sally, who got up from where she’d been playing cards. It was then that she noticed the food in my hands. "Oh, you shouldn't have!"

"It’s no trouble, really."

Eric looked over to his wife. "Ah, I think what Sally means is, we try to avoid that sort of stuff."

"Thai?"

"No. Not the food, the containers."

"Oh," I said with a grimace. "Next time."

"Of course," said Eric. "Come and sit down."

So we sat on the floor and ate our food. By the time we were done, Alex had assembled the discarded takeaway boxes and rearranged then into a replica of the house--complete with spoon driveway and straw washing line.

"Can I hold her?" asked Sally. "It's been a while since Alex was that little."

"Uh--sure," I said, a little reluctantly.

While Jane and Sally played with Cola, hunched over in their meditative poses, Eric ushered me out to the backyard.

"How's being a dad?" said Eric, washing lemonade over his lips.

"Cola's a great kid."

"That's it?"

I shrugged. "What else?"

"I don't know, Charlie boy. It all passes too quickly. I'm already worrying about what high school he's going to."

"I'm sure he'll turn out just fine," I said.

"No. It's just that, don't you think about the future?" Eric said, reading the lines on his palm as if they'd tell him what he needed to know. "I think about it all the time."

"Are you kidding me?" I said. Eric threw up his arms in mock protest. "I don't have time to think about the future. I've got more immediate problems."

"Sure. I get that. The world's full of problems to solve..."

"Charlie!" came Jane's voice--heightened--from inside the house.

The girls hadn't moved when we returned but Jane broke off from their huddle at our return. The smiles they'd been wearing earlier were gone.

"Look," she said, pointing to Cola's arm but I could already see what she meant.

"What happened?" I demanded. Cola was going to ride a bike one day, and if she broke her arm doing that, then that was okay. She was going to go on holidays and visit strange, new countries; she could break her arm climbing some stupid mountain then. But not now. Not here. Not while I was supposed to be watching her.

"It just kind of did that itself," said Sally.

"Arms don't just break," I heard myself say as I picked Cola up. "We've got to take her to the hospital."

And so we left with none of the niceties we'd come in with. We rushed to the hospital only to find ourselves stopped by the triage nurse. While we sat in the waiting room, I tried to get some rest and Jane and Cola watched as the sick came and went.

The doctor that eventually saw us was too young.

"What's wrong with her?" I asked, when the x-ray had come back.

The doctor frowned. "I'm not sure. I've never seen anything like it."

Jane and I looked at each other nervously.

"I think we'll have to refer you to a specialist," she said, her small hands flitting across her keyboard as she typed out a referral.

"How much are we talking?"

"This sort of thing is always expensive. Surgery to fix a fused bone can be upwards of ten thousand dollars."

"Charlie, we'll never be able to afford it."

"Nevermind that," I said. "Did you see the x-ray? Her arm... it looked just like one of the spoons from dinner."

"What do you mean?" asked Jane.

But a small cry stopped me before I could explain.

"Cola?"

Her stomach gave a threatening rumble in response.

"No!" I cried. "Just wait."

The doctor directed me to the nearest baby room, two floors down.

So I tumbled down two flights of stairs with a click-clack, as steadily as if a trail of dominos had been laid out before me and were collapsing one by one. I whirled around aimlessly until I came across the sign pointing to the baby room.

The glare of the hospital died and gave way to the pitch-black silence and deafening night of the passage. The lights were out, so I stumbled around, searching for a way forward. As I reached through the dark, something warm spread across my stomach. I dipped my hand down and it was met with dampness. I felt around, only to find that Cola was unnaturally still and not even the sound of breathing came back to me in the corridor. I listened harder but the vacuum was pervasive--had it eaten everything up, light and sound alike? It was impossible to say.

I moved faster now, fumbling for the door. I reached a wall and traced my hands along it until my hands closed around a handle. I pressed down and pushed the door open letting a fluorescent glow spill into the passage. Holding my hand up under the light, I realised it was covered in something red.

"Oh my god" I yelled. But it was sticky--stickier than blood should be. It had the smell of overripe cherries.

I lifted Cola out of her baby carrier and placed her on the change table, turning away for a moment to pull her things out of my bag. But as I turned back, I stopped what I was doing, leaving a wet wipe dangling from my left hand and a disposable nappy from the other. Cola no longer lay in front of me; not the real Cola anyway. The thing before me was no more her than a picture--something flat, unmoving, with just a whiff of the real thing left in it to tease me.

I called Jane--she was the only one that would understand what I was going through--and so she came to find me. We drove back from the hospital in silence, her saturnine hair draped over her forehead like a veil, my hands clutched together in my lap.

"I'm sorry," I said. Jane continued to stare soundlessly at the road ahead. I looked back at the crumpled pile of plastic on the back seat. "It's just that--maybe you were right about giving her a name."

Jane shook her head. We arrived home and I scooped up the bundle of plastic and all of Cola's things. Together, Jane and I found a place on the pile of decorations at the back of the garage. When we were done, I tugged the cord above me and turned out the dim garage light. Jane sent her eyes over in my direction and we shared a glance that carried with it a thousand words.

It was the thought of all the things we'd planned to do together. Of all the laughter and heartache the past few days had given us. Maybe Eric was right--maybe I hadn't given the future enough thought. It had come rushing at me--with all of the weight of my bad choices. And now I had to deal with it sooner than I'd expected. I let all of my thoughts sift down into the recesses of my mind, somewhere they might eventually be forgotten. At long last, I opened my mouth to give form to the words on my tongue and said, "I think I need that drink now."
