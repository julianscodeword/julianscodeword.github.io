title: About
---

<p>I've been writing, editing and reviewing technical documents in a professional environment for over ten years. I'm also a freelance web developer, part-time novelist, self-employed cook, most-of-the-time dreamer and full-time dad.</p>

Most recently, I've worn the hat of Data Engineer for one of Australia's leading online businesses, and <img class="decoration" src="/assets/img/me.jpg" alt="me" />before that I engineered software solutions for companies in industries as diverse as finance, telecommunications, and smart lighting.

<p>It's pretty enjoyable and enlightening to work with people across sectors and to explore such a variety of subject matter. <q class="decoration right">Get in touch and let's work together!</q>One thing it's taught me is to value someone's willingness to learn, their ability to work with others and their future potential over whatever mindblowing skill they might already have.</p>

Regardless of whether I'm writing a technical document, a long-form article, or I'm tapping out some code, I work hard to find ways to communicate ideas in a clear and effective way. I'll always see things through to the end, and along the way I'll stay passionate about finding the right hook that will draw people in, and creating substance that will keep them reading until the very last word.

If you've got something technical that you need to get written, I'm interested. Get in touch with me on my <a href="/contact">contact page</a>. I promise I'll save my technobabble (and my French) for when and where it's appropriate!
