> G'day! I'm a writer, and I'm here to help you succeed.

I've been writing and reviewing documents in a professional environment for over ten years. Having worked as a Data Engineer at both online businesses and consulting companies in industries as diverse as finance and smart lighting. I am comfortable communicating ideas in a way that makes sense to readers, even when they don't speak technobabble.

I'm a huge advocate of the plain English movement; I communicate ideas in a clear and effective way regardless of what I'm writing. Whether it be a technical document, a long-form article, or a creative writing piece, I am forever passionate about finding a hook that will draw readers in and substance that will keep them reading until the very last word.

In my many other lives, I've also been a freelance software engineer, a part-time novelist, self-employed cook, a most-of-the-time thinker and a full-time dad.
