> I can give you a voice that's loud and clear!

I've been writing, editing and reviewing technical documents in a professional environment for over ten years. Some other hats I wear are freelance web developer, part-time novelist, self-employed cook, most-of-the-time thinker and full-time dad.

Most recently, I've worn the hat of Data Engineer for one of Australia's leading online businesses, and before that I engineered software solutions for companies in industries as diverse as finance, telecommunications, and smart lighting.

Working with different people and even more varied subject matter has been illuminating. For one, I've learnt to value someone's willingness to learn, their ability to work with others and their future potential over whatever mindblowing skill they might already have.

> I promise I'll save my technobabble for when and where it's needed.

Iâ€™m a huge advocate of the plain English movement in case I haven't made it obvious already. But having moved around and dabbling a bit in everything has also taught me a philosophy that crosses disciplines. Regardless of what industry you're in or what sort of work you're doing, clear communication is vital. A software developer that thinks they're only job is to write writing code that works isn't a very good developer. A better developer knows that readability is just as important for long-term success as getting the job done. And the same goes for communicating in any language.

> I look forward to working together!

Whether it be a technical document, a long-form article, or a creative writing piece, I work hard to find ways to communicate ideas in a clear and effective way. I am forever passionate about finding a hook that will draw readers in and substance that will keep them reading until the very last word.
