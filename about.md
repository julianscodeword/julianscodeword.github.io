I reckon a good writer is like Leonardo Dicaprio's character in Inception. If you've seen the 2010 classic, then think of that; if you haven't, then this is all going to fall flat (in that case, think Jack the Giant slayer–the 2013 box-office flop). In the film, a team of people enter someone’s dreams to plant an idea. The aim is it plant it so deeply that their target has no idea how it got there.

As technical writers, even though our readers are wide awake (unless your target audience is narcoleptics), our goal is still the same–we want our audience to be left with an idea. When words get in the way, we haven't done our job.

And... we're back. I’ve been writing and reviewing documents in a professional environment for over ten years. Having worked as a Data Engineer at both online businesses and consulting companies in industries as diverse as finance and smart lighting, communicating ideas in a way that makes sense to readers is just as natural to me as speaking techobabble (or Scala).

I’m a huge advocate of the plain English movement, so I communicate ideas in a clear and effective way regardless of what I’m writing. Whether it be a technical document, a long-form article, or a creative writing piece, I am forever passionate about finding a hook that will draw readers in and substance that will keep them reading until the very last word.

In my many other lives, I’ve also been a freelance software engineer, a part-time novelist, self-employed cook, a most-of-the-time thinker and a full-time dad.
