Hi!

I'm a freelance web developer, part-time novelist, self-employed cook, some-of-the-time sleeper and full-time dreamer. Most recently, I worked as a Data Engineer at Envato, an online marketplace home to more than 10 million users and 50 million products.

I've been developing software for over 14 years in industries as diverse as insurance and sports wearables. Over the years, I've used written a lot of C#, Java and Python code, and I'm well versed in web technologies both frontend and backend. I completed ScrumMaster training in 2016, and have used version control, CI/CD and virtualisation for many years across an interesting mix of teams and projects.

In the last 5 years, I have been heavily invested in data technologies including Spark and databases both SQL and NoSQL. The ever-growing amount of data that needs to be stored, processed and analysed is daunting, but it is also exciting.

Some of my most notable projects include:
* Helping to modernise Envato's data platform by moving it to AWS. While there, I participated in their regular Hack Weeks and delivered organisation-wide presentations about our team's new initiatives.
* At Symbiotech, I managed a team that built an ingestion pipeline, a web interface and an iOS app to support an IoT connected mouthguard for tracking concussions sustained while playing sport.
* At Organic Response, a smart lighting company, I co-developed an ingestion pipeline and a web portal for managing smart lighting data from office buildings. The pipeline and portal were deployed to various buildings around the world, including Telstra and AGL offices.

It's pretty enjoyable and enlightening to work with such diverse people across sectors and to explore an amazingly broad variety of subject matter. I've ever been part of a few recruitment pannels in my time. One thing it's all taught me is to value someone's willingness to learn, their ability to work with others and their future potential over whatever mindblowing skill they might already have.

If you've got a web or data problem that you need solved, then I'm all ears (and madly typing fingers). <a href="/contact">Get in touch</a> if you're interested in working together.
