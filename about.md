I've been writing, editing and reviewing technical documents in a professional environment for over ten years. Most recently, I've worn the hat of Data Engineer for one of Australia's leading online businesses, and before that I engineered software solutions for companies in industries as diverse as finance, telecommunications, and smart lighting. Working with such vastly different subject matter has been illuminating. For one, I've learnt to value someone's willingness to learn, their humility and their future potential over whatever mindblowing skill they might already have.

Something else it's taught me is that regardless of what industry you're in or what sort of work you're doing, you're communicating. A software developer that thinks they're just writing code that works isn't a very good developer. A really good developer knows that readability is just as important for long-term success as getting the job done. And the same goes for writing in any language—communicating in a way that makes sense to your audience. I promise I'll save my technobabble for when and where it's needed.

I’m a huge advocate of the plain English movement; No matter what I'm writing, I look for ways to communicate ideas in a clear and effective way. Whether it be a technical document, a long-form article, or a creative writing piece, I am forever passionate about finding a hook that will draw readers in and substance that will keep them reading until the very last word.

In my many other lives, I’ve also been a freelance software engineer, a part-time novelist, self-employed cook, a most-of-the-time thinker and a full-time dad.
