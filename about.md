I've been writing, editing and reviewing technical documents in a professional environment for over ten years. I'm also a freelance web developer, a part-time novelist, self-employed cook, most-of-the-time dreamer and a full-time dad.

Most recently, I've worn the hat of Data Engineer for one of Australia's leading online businesses, and before that I engineered software solutions for companies in industries as diverse as finance, telecommunications, and smart lighting.

It has been enlightening to work with people across sectors and to explore such a variety of subject matter. One thing it's taught me is to value someone's willingness to learn, their ability to work with others and their future potential over whatever mindblowing skill they might already have.

Iâ€™m also a huge advocate of the plain English movement (in case I haven't made it obvious already). But having moved around and dabbling a bit in everything has also taught me a philosophy that crosses disciplines. Regardless of what industry you're in or what sort of work you're doing, clear communication is vital. A software developer that thinks their only job is just to write working code isn't a very good developer. A better developer knows that readability is just as important for long-term success as getting the job done. And, honestly, the same goes for communicating in any language.

Whether it be a technical document, a long-form article, or a creative writing piece, I work hard to find ways to communicate ideas in a clear and effective way. I see everything through to the end, but until we get there, I will remain passionate about finding the right hook that will draw readers in, and creating substance that will keep people reading until the very last word.

If you've got something technical that you need to get written, I'm here to help. You can get in touch with me via my <a href="/contact">contact page</a>. Oh, and I promise I'll save my technobabble (and my French) for when and where it's needed.
