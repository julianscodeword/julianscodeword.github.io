G'day! I'm a writer and I want to help you succeed.

I've been writing and reviewing documents in a professional environment for more than ten years. Having worked as a Data Engineer at both online businesses and consulting companies in industries as diverse as finance and smart lighting, I am very comfortable communicating with both technical and non-technical readers in a way that makes sense to them.

I'm also a huge advocate for the plain English movement; with every piece of work, I aim to communicate technical ideas in a clear and effective way. Whether it be a technical document, a long-form article, or a creative writing piece, I am forever passionate about finding a hook that will draw readers in and substance that will keep them reading until the very last word.

In other lives, I've also been a freelance software engineer, a part-time novelist, self-employed cook, a most-of-the-time thinker and a full-time dad.
