I am an experienced data engineer who has worked with both web companies and small, medium and large businesses in the finance, telecom, energy and smart building industries.

This work has honed my skills in data engineering, web technologies, cloud computing and agile methodologies. It is also here that I've experienced first-hand the transformation of vast and unintelligible data into something that can shape the future. I believe it is my role to help unlock this potential that exists within data. 

I am a writer and I'm here to help you succeed! I have been writing and reviewing documents in a professional environment for the last ten years. Having worked at both web and software consulting companies, I am comfortable communicating with technical readers in language that makes sense to them. I am also a big proponent of the plain English movementâ€”with every piece of work, I aim to communicate technical ideas in a clear and effective way. Whether it be a technical document, a long-form article, or a creative writing piece, I am always passionate about finding a story that will engage readers and keep them hooked until the very last word.
