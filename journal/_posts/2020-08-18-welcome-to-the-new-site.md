G'day! I reckon a good writer is like Leonardo Dicaprio's character in Inception. If you've seen the 2010 classic, then think of that; if you haven't, then my analogy is guaranteed to fall flat and it's probably more apt to think of Jack the Giant slayer, the 2013 box-office flop. Anyway, back to Inception—it's all about a team of people enter someone’s dreams to plant an idea. The aim is to plant their idea so deeply that their target has no idea how it got there.

> Cobb: "Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate.

As technical writers, even though our readers are wide awake (unless your target audience is narcoleptics), our goal is much the same–we want our audience to be left with an idea. When words get in the way, we haven't done our job.
