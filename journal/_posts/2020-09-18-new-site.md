G'day! I reckon a good writer is like Leonardo Dicaprio's character in Inception. If you've seen the 2010 classic, then think of that; if you haven't, then this analogy is going to fall flat (so maybe think of Jack the Giant slayer, the 2013 box-office flop instead). Anyway, Inception—it's all about going into someone’s subconscious to plant an idea. The aim is to plant the idea so deeply that their target has no idea how it got there.
