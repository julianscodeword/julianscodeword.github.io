November is fast approaching, and you know what that means? **NaNoWriMo!** Nano-what!? Okay, so [here's a link](https://nanowrimo.org) for the uninitiated. Not that I'm a veteran or anything; far from it. I've been writing for a long time, and I've definitely been aware of the novel writing month for almost as long. For whatever reason—life getting in the way, fear, something else—I've never taken part. But 2020 is the year!

What's not to be excited about? I'll be joining a huge community of like-minded people and spurring myself onwards and upwards towards the goal of 50,000 words in one month. I've been listening to some writing podcasts recently and have only heard good things about the project.

In the lead up to the big date, I'm doing big-scale planning of the overall story arc. I'm what you'd call a plotter in writing parlance; that is, someone who is so totally neurotic that they have to plan every detail of their novel down to the smallest of details. I'm talking what pattern the main character's socks are, shifting meteorological patterns over the course of the novel, languages with Klingon-like detail, that sort of thing.

Actually, it makes me wonder whether anyone has gone agile on a creative task. Just once, I'd love to hear a writing talk about the Kanban board they used to draft their novel.

Or, let's give this a go:

<pre><code>As a reader,
Having purchased your book,
I want to open to the first page,
So that I'm transported to another time and place.</code></pre>

Okay, so I don't think user stories for stories is going to catch on anytime soon, but here's to November being a little bit of light in an otherwise glum year. Good luck to anyone else who's joining in!
