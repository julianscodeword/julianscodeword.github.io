November is fast approaching, and you know what that means? **NaNoWriMo!** Nano-what!? Okay, so [here's a link](https://nanowrimo.org) for the uninitiated. Not that I'm a veteran or anything; far from it. I've been writing for a long time, and I've definitely been aware of the novel writing month for almost as long. For whatever reason—life getting in the way, fear, something else—I've never taken part. But 2020 is the year!

What's not to be excited about? I'll be joining a huge community of like-minded people and spurring myself onwards and upwards towards the goal of 50,000 words in one month. I've been listening to some writing podcasts recently and have only heard good things about the project.

In the lead up to the big date, I'm doing big-scale planning of my overall story arc. I'm what you'd call a plotter in writing parlance; that is, someone who is so totally neurotic that they have to plan every detail of their novel down to the smallest of details. I'm talking what pattern the main character's socks are, shifting meteorological patterns over the course of the novel, languages with Klingon-like detail, that sort of thing.

Actually, all of this makes me wonder whether anyone has gone agile on a creative task. Just once, I'd love to hear a writer talk about the Kanban board they used to draft their novel.

Or, wait, how about this?

No, it's not a [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku). It's a [user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Sure, user stories for stories probably won't catch on anytime soon, but NaNoWriMo has been around for a while, so it looks like it's here to stay.

I'll see how things go; maybe I'll update here as the month progresses. I might even give you a look into my writing process. Either way, I'm looking forward to November being a little bit of light in an otherwise glum year.

Good luck to anyone else who's joining in and stay tuned!
