[Here's](https://css-tricks.com/balancing-on-a-pivot-with-flexbox/) the article.

CSS tricks is a great resource for frontend developers. It's hard to do a google search on something angular, javascript or CSS without one of their articles popping up. Reportedly, they get around 7 million views every month, which is an enviable number and a testament to how relevant and useful their content is!

They've published articles from lots of great developers, which is why I was stoked when they agreed to publish one of my articles. The article details how I used flexbox to solve a design problem I encountered while creating my own website. Everyone I worked with in getting the article out there was supportive and humble. Chris himself was super nice and very involved despite how busy I imagine he must be!

Head over to CSS-Tricks and read [my article](https://css-tricks.com/balancing-on-a-pivot-with-flexbox/) when you get a moment. And while you're there, check out all of the latest stuff they have going on there.
