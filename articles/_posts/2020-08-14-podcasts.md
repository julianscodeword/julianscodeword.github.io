Rabbits follows Carly Parker as she investigates the disappearance of her best friend, Yumiko. Despite the mysterious circumstances surrounding her friend's disappearance and the apparent danger of the situation, curiosity gets the better of our protagonist, and she dives head-first into the titular alternate reality game.

Some people have been turned off by the show's voice acting, which can be a bit repetitive and wooden at times, and the heavy exposition of the first episode. It's also been criticized for being unrealistic--Carly seems a bit unfazed by the danger around her and, like many podcasts in this vein, some of the excuses for having the recorder rolling are a bit contrived. But if you can look past these gripes, you'll enjoy a satisfying romp that is guaranteed to delight enthusiasts of computer games, conspiracies on a global scale, and things that go bump in the night.

The story reaches a satisfying conclusion, but leaves enough unanswered to allow for more seasons. Sadly, time ran out on a Kickstarter campaign that was run to fund a second season.

That said, if you hear whispers that **the door is open** again, then let me know.
